The difference between the approach to 8.14 and the approach to 8.15 focuses on the object-oriented idea in programming.
The goal of both problems is to find the surface area and volume of different 3d figures.  8.14 approaches it in a
static way, looking at the volume and surface area as parameters to be found.  8.15, on the other hand, looks at
volume/surface area as properties of each certain geometric shape.

Which approach is most effective depends on what the programmer is trying to accomplish.  8.14 is similar to the math
library, which is useful because it declares many static methods that can be used in a one-off way without
instantiating objects.  If the programmer wishes to use the 3d objects as building blocks to other arrays or methods
it makes much more sense to follow the structure of 8.15.  It is much easier to create and manipulate many different
objects when they are each created separately and have their own properties.
